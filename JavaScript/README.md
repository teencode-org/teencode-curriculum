  - For data type `booleans` print the string `The truth will set you free` if true
  - For data type `booleans` print the string `Do not tell lies` if false
  - For data type `number` return a string showing how it compares to 100 e.g. For `67` print `'less than 100'` for `4034` print `'more than 100'` or `equal to 100` as the case may be
  - For `arrays` print the 3rd index, or `undefined` if the 3rd index does not exist.
  - For `arrays` add the string “Extra Value” to the array and print new array to screen.
