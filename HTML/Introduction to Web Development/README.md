# How Does the Internet Work?

Before we explain html, Let’s talk briefly talk on how the internet works. Have you ever thought about this? How does the computers all around the world communicate with each other?

**Facilitator:** Have the students try this out on a web browser and explain what is going on in the background.

Let’s look at web browsing. 
<ul>
  <li>First, you open a web browser (it is the app used to access a web pages).</li>
  <li>Next, you enter a url or address of the website you want to visit. e.g andela.com or google.com</li>
  <li>Hit enter</li>
</ul>

In that moment, your computer starts talking to another computer called a server that is usually miles away using a language called HTTP(Hyper text transfer protocol). It tells the computer(google’s server) that you want all of the HTML code for the google login page.
