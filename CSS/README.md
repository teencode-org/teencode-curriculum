### Formatting Text
After any length of time on the Internet, you’ll notice that a web page is made up of more than just plain words on a screen. There are headlines, paragraphs, graphics, colors and much more. It’s a lively place to be. HTML defines special elements for defining text with a special meaning. Formatting elements are designed to display special types of text. Examples of formatting elements are:

| Element                  | Description                        |
| -------                  | -----------                        |
| <b>...</b>               |                                    |
| ```                      |                                    |
| ```html                  | Defines italic text                |
| ```html                  | Defines bold text                  |
| <i>...</i>               |                                    |
| ```                      |                                    |
| ```html                  | Begin a new paragraph              |
| <p>...</p>               |                                    |
| ```                      |                                    |
| ```html                  | Defines marked/highlighted text    |
| <mark>...</mark>         |                                    |
| ```                      |                                    |
| ```html                  | It is called the headline tag.     |
| <h1>…</h1> to <h6>…</h6> | It creates a bold copy             |
| ```                      |                                    |
| ```html                  | Defines subscripted text           |
| <sub>...</sub>           |                                    |
| ```                      |                                    |
